# Manipulation

Ask the user to enter a sentence. Save the user’s response in a variable called str_manip.

Using this string value, write the code to do the following:

○ Calculate and display the length of str_manip.

○ Find the last letter in str_manip. Replace every occurence of this
letter in str_manip with ‘@’. E.g. if str_manip = “This is a bunch of
words”, the output would be “Thi@ i@ a bunch of word@”

○ Print the last 3 characters in str_manip backwards. E.g. if str_manip
= “This is a bunch of words”, the output would be “sdr”.

○ Create a ﬁve-letter word that is made up of the ﬁrst three characters
and the last two characters in str_manip. E.g. if str_manip = “This is a
bunch of words”, the output would be “Thids”.

○ Display each word on a new line.
